# ProcessIQ

**ProcessIQ** is an AI-powered Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) creation and analysis tool developed as part of the **Koru Problem Hunt Case Competition**. This repository contains:

1. **[Landing Page](https://processiq.onrender.com/) Code**: A showcase of the tool's potential with a user-friendly interface.
2. **Pilot Prototype Demo Code**: Demonstrates the core functionality of ProcessIQ by using the **Gemini API** to process user input and generate basic process flow diagrams.

## What are P&IDs?

**Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs)** are critical schematics that depict the interconnection of process equipment and instrumentation in industrial facilities. They play an essential role in multiple industries, including:

- **Chemical Processing**
- **Oil & Gas**
- **Pharmaceuticals**
- **Power Generation**

### Why are P&IDs Important?

- **Design**: Ensure precise planning of process systems.
- **Operation**: Aid in understanding and controlling industrial processes.
- **Maintenance**: Help identify equipment and instrumentation for troubleshooting.
- **Safety & Compliance**: Ensure adherence to industry regulations and standards.

## What We Aim to Achieve with ProcessIQ

ProcessIQ is designed to streamline and modernize P&ID workflows with the following **core capabilities**:

1. **P&ID Creation from Textual Input**:
   - Engineers can input textual descriptions of processes, and ProcessIQ will generate accurate P&ID schematics.
   
2. **Analysis of Existing P&IDs**:
   - Detect errors, inconsistencies, and optimization opportunities in current diagrams.
   
3. **Legacy Diagram Conversion**:
   - Simplify the digitization of legacy P&IDs into modern, editable formats.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Tailored for both technical users (engineers) and non-technical users, ensuring accessibility and ease of use.
